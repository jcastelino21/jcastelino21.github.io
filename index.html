    <h2><center><u>Key Points</u></center></h2>
    <h3>• The year "Zero" does not exist</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>• For BCE/BC: The higher the number, the EARLIER the event happened.
        Example: The year 1000 BCE happened BEFORE the year 500 BCE</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>• For AD/BCE: The higher the number, the LATER the event happened.
        Example: The year 2000 CE happened AFTER the year 1000 CE</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>• When discussing modern times in the common era, 'ce' is often assumed
        Example: The year 2018 can be simplified to just 2018</h3>

    <h2><center><u>How To Determine Age</u></center></h2>
    <h3>• If both numbers are in BCE/BC:
            Take the number of the older event, (the larger number) and SUBTRACT the more recent
            event (the smaller number).
        Example: 545 BCE - 445 BCE = 100 Years</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>• If both numbers are in AD/BCE:
            Take the number of the more recent event, (the larger number) and SUBTRACT the older 
        event (the smaller number)
        Example: 2010 - 1910 = 100 Years</h3>
